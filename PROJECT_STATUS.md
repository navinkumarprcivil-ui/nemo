# Nemo Aqua Store — Project Status & Handoff

**Live:** https://www.nemoaquastore.in · **Deploy:** Cloudflare Workers (`nemo-aqua-store`) · **Backend:** Firebase Realtime DB + Storage

> Read this first when resuming in a new chat. It captures how the project is built and what's done / pending.

## How the app is built (IMPORTANT)
- Single-file React app. Source of truth: **`app.jsx`** (~10.8k lines, in-browser React via `React.createElement`).
- The site loads a **precompiled `app.js`** (fast path); `app.jsx` is only a fallback.
- **After ANY change to `app.jsx`, rebuild `app.js`:**
  `npx esbuild app.jsx --loader:.jsx=jsx --jsx=transform --bundle=false --minify --outfile=app.js`
  then `node --check app.js`. Commit **both** files. (Keep `--minify` — the shipped bundle is minified.)
- Bump the service-worker cache in `sw.js` (`nemo-vNN`) on releases so clients refresh.
- Firebase rules live in `database.rules.json` (must be published in Firebase console separately).
- Theme = "PRISTINE AQUA" (pure white, Plus Jakarta Sans, cyan `#0ea5e9` accents, coral `#f43f5e` CTAs). Central token object `const C` at top of `app.jsx`.

## Workflow
Website source lives in GitHub on `main`. Build with `npm run build`; deploy the website with `npm run deploy` to Cloudflare Workers. Native Android changes are made separately in Android Studio and require a new signed AAB/versionCode; website-only changes do **not** require a new AAB.

## Done ✅
- Full storefront + admin: catalog, cart, checkout (flexible: add-items/change-shipping/cancel), orders, wallet/loyalty, referrals.
- Returns/replacement flow + DOA flow (customer choice: refund/replace/coins).
- Admin sales dashboard + customer insights + behaviour analytics (funnel, top products, searches).
- Smart search (typo/synonym/plural tolerant — "beta"→Betta). Aqua Tools page (fish compatibility checker + tank/heater/filter/stocking calculators).
- Interactive UI: 3D card tilt+spotlight, magnetic CTAs, fly-to-cart, reveal-on-scroll, staggered grids, spring-count prices.
- Mini-cart drawer + Zepto-style floating cart bar (free-delivery nudge).
- Abandoned-cart recovery: cart persists across sessions (localStorage); a signed-in shopper's open cart syncs to Firebase (`abandonedCarts/<uid>`) and shows in Admin → Orders with a one-tap WhatsApp nudge + Dismiss. The `abandonedCarts` node is covered by the rules published 7 Sept 2026.
- Flipkart-style rating: tap-to-rate in order list + per-aspect ratings (condition/packing/delivery/value).
- Cinematic splash (wordmark logo, bubbles). Ambient fish-canvas wallpaper (betta+clownfish desktop-only, snails+bubbles everywhere).
- PWA store-ready: manifest (id, screenshots, shortcuts, categories), `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` (pkg `in.nemoaquastore.app`), `/privacy.html`.
- SEO: schema.org, sitemap, static `/p/` product pages + `/guides/` blog articles.
- Icons unified to the clownfish; new 1200×630 share banner.
- **GST live (GSTIN `33BWXPP8706N1ZI`, Tamil Nadu):** once a GSTIN is saved in Settings, the formal invoice (`openInvoice` → `generateInvoiceHTML`) becomes a proper **Tax Invoice** with HSN, place of supply, and the correct tax split — **CGST+SGST for deliveries inside TN, IGST for every other state**. Checkout now collects **State**, auto-detected from the delivery pincode via `pincodeToState()` (editable dropdown if the pincode is unrecognised) and stored on the order; the invoice falls back to pincode derivation for older orders. Puducherry pockets (Pondicherry town, Karaikal, Yanam, Mahe) are special-cased to UT 34 → IGST. Settings shows a live "✓ Valid GSTIN · Seller state: TAMIL NADU (33)" confirmation under the GSTIN field. Prices are treated as GST-inclusive; default rate/HSN in Settings, per-product override supported. **We deliberately do NOT store/show the GST certificate image** (it carries the proprietor's personal address; only the GSTIN is shown, which is all that's legally required online).

## Play Store launch — LIVE STATUS (updated 28 Aug 2026)
**Account type: PERSONAL** → closed testing is being used before production access.
Package: `in.nemoaquastore.app`. The app is now a native Android **WebView** wrapper (not TWA) built in Android Studio. Current closed-testing release: **11 (2.0.0)**, `targetSdk 36`, available to selected testers. Keep using the permanent original `signing.keystore` / upload key — NEVER commit it.

**DONE ✅**
- App created in Play Console; app-signing enabled.
- `.aab` uploaded to **Internal testing** (Active). App verified opening full-screen (no browser bar).
- **assetlinks.json** has BOTH fingerprints: upload key `2B:EA:…:54` + Google Play app-signing key `E9:85:…:D4`. Verified via Google's digital-asset-links API.
- **App content declarations all done:** Ads (No), Sign-in details (demo account — see below), Content rating (Everyone/PEGI3; Germany USK16 only), Target audience (18+), Data safety (submitted), Financial features (none), Privacy policy (`/privacy.html`).
- **Store listing** written (name, short desc, full desc), category Shopping, contact details. Feature graphic (1024×500) + share banner made by user. App icon = `assets/favicon-512.png`.
- **Reviewer demo login**: sign-in screen has a sandboxed demo mode (PR #15). Reviewer instructions given in Play "Sign-in details".
- `/delete-account.html` live (required Delete-account URL for Data safety).
- **In-app "Delete my account" + admin deletion panel — MERGED to `main` (PR #18).** Account screen → danger card (tick-to-confirm) wipes the customer's reachable cloud data (saved items, abandoned cart, own tank photos), logs an **Account deletion request** in Admin → Requests (badged), and signs the user out. Orders/payment records retained (tax law). Admin → Requests shows it in red with one-tap "Delete remaining data" (wallet/loyalty coins + referral mapping) + WhatsApp "Confirm to customer". Demo/review sessions just clear + sign out. Rules published 7 Sept 2026: the admin uid has delete access to `favorites` + `userrefs`, so the one-tap purge is complete.

**"Get it on Google Play" badges on the website — DONE ✅**
Now that the app is live, the site points customers at it in three places, all sharing one `.gp-badge` style block (defined in `index.html` so the top banner can use it before React mounts):
- **Top install banner** (`index.html`) — three-way split by platform. **Android**: badge only, replacing the PWA "Install" button (copy is deliberately terse — "Get the Nemo app" / "Now on Google Play" — because the badge eats ~155px and longer text wrapped to five lines on a phone). **Desktop**: badge *and* Install button side by side (`.ib-dual`), since installing the site is the offer that works on that machine; the badge drops out under 700px so the two never crowd each other. **iOS**: no badge — an Android app is a dead end on an iPhone — so it keeps the add-to-home-screen hint.
- **Desktop home footer** — a "Get the App" column (`PlayAppBlock`, `app.jsx`), sitting between Follow Us and Secure Payment.
- **Mobile side menu** — same block at the bottom of the drawer, because `.home-footer` is desktop-only.

Details worth knowing:
- Artwork is Google's own PNG, hot-linked from `play.google.com` so it always matches their current brand guidelines. It carries **built-in clear-space padding**, so the `<img>` is 60px tall to render the ~40px visible badge Google requires as a minimum — don't "fix" that by shrinking it. If the image can't load (offline, or a network that blocks Google), a styled `.gp-fb` fallback takes its place so the slot never shows a broken image. To self-host instead, download the badge from <https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/> and swap the two `src` values (banner in `index.html`, `PlayBadge` in `app.jsx`).
- Every badge links with a `referrer=utm_source=website&utm_medium=<where>` param (`playUrl()` in `app.jsx`), so **Play Console → Acquisition** attributes installs to the site and tells you which placement earned them.
- **The badges hide themselves** when there's no point offering the app: inside the installed app/TWA, or when Chrome's `navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()` says the Play app is already on the device. That probe is why `manifest.webmanifest` now declares `related_applications` (pkg `in.nemoaquastore.app`) — it needs the manifest entry *and* the matching `assetlinks.json`, both of which are in place. `prefer_related_applications` is deliberately **false**: Android users can still install the PWA if they'd rather not use the Play app.
- The `usePlayAppOffer()` hook is what callers use to drop a whole "Get the App" section, so a heading never survives a badge that removed itself.

**Android release baseline (28 Aug 2026):** versionCode **11**, versionName **2.0.0**, minSdk **24**, targetSdk **36**. Release signing and the embedded AAB certificate were verified against the original upload key. Do not rebuild/upload a new AAB for ordinary website changes; only native Android changes require incrementing the versionCode and uploading another signed bundle.

**NEXT — the ONLY thing gating production ⏳** (in progress: 12 testers opted in, ~8 days as of late Jul 2026)
1. **Closed testing**: create release (Add-from-library, use the **API-36** `.aab`) → country India → add **12+ tester Gmails** → roll out for review.
2. **Get 12 testers OPTED IN** via the opt-in link (iPhone users can opt in but can't install — use Android testers). 14-day clock starts once 12 are in.
3. After 14 days → **Apply for production** → answer closed-test questions → create production release (the API-36 build) → submit → live.

**Open build tasks:**
- Optional "Report content" button → would raise rating Teen→Everyone (fixes Germany USK16).
- Birthday field (Personal info→Other info, NOT Calendar) for b'day offers — future.

## Exports — the contract with the external analytics app (Aug 2026)
A separate analytics app is being built on these files, so **treat the columns as a published API: append, never insert or rename.** Admin → Export now offers four downloads, all UTF-8-with-BOM, CRLF, every cell quoted, and all range filters applied to `placedAt` (when the order was *placed*, not paid or delivered).

| File | Function | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `nemo-orders-<range>.csv` | `exportOrdersCSV` | **66 cols**, one row per order, newest first |
| `nemo-order-items-<range>.csv` | `exportOrderItemsCSV` | **32 cols**, one row per line item + one per order's shipping |
| `nemo-inventory-<date>.csv` | `exportProductsCSV` | **21 cols**, one row per sellable unit (product, or product × option) |
| `nemo-gst-hsn-<range>.csv` | `exportGstHsnCSV` | **11 cols**, one row per HSN × rate × supply-type, then `TOTAL`, then prose notes |

- **ISO date columns.** `fmtDate` renders "2 Aug, 05:29 am" — **no year** — which is right on screen and unusable for reporting. Every export therefore also carries full ISO-8601 UTC via `isoStamp()`. On the orders sheet these are the last three columns (64–66: Placed/Paid/Delivered), *appended* so a positional reader doesn't break. Prefer them over the display columns for anything computational.
- **Line items exist so nobody has to parse the packed `Items` cell.** Each row carries its pro-rata share of the order discount and its own tax, from the same `orderTaxLines` engine as the invoice — so **`sum(Line Net)` over an order equals that order's invoice value** (verified). Shipping is its own row, riding the principal supply's rate.
- **Tax columns are blank, not zero, when `Counts for GST = No`** (cancelled or never paid). Blank means *excluded from the return*, and a consumer that coerces it to 0 will still be right on totals but wrong on counts.
- **`No-GST Value` is outside GST entirely** (live fish), not zero-rated — report as exempt/non-GST.
- **Inventory is a snapshot, not a history.** The store keeps no stock history, so `Snapshot At (ISO)` is identical across one file and charting stock over time means exporting on a schedule and keeping the files.
- **Formula guard**: any cell starting with `= + - @ tab CR` gets a leading `'` (spreadsheets execute those). Strip it before parsing numbers — a refund can arrive as `'-50`.
- **Full backup now covers all 20 nodes**, not the original 8. It previously omitted the whole behavioural side — `abandonedCarts, analytics, experienceReviews, favorites, interest, loyalty, orderSeq, promoUsage, referrals, restock, testimonials, userrefs`. Nodes the admin can't read are skipped, not fatal.
- **Known gap:** GST credit notes for sales returns are generated as documents (`generateCreditNoteHTML`) but are **not** in any CSV. GSTR-1 credit notes remain manual; the orders sheet's return columns (60–63) flag which orders need one. COGS is also absent store-wide, so true margin can't be computed from these files.

## Returns & GST credit notes
- **Two return addresses** in Settings → About & Policies (Address 1 + Address 2, each with a short name). Admin **picks which address** when handling a return (Admin → order → Return panel); the choice is snapshotted onto the request and shown to the customer ("Courier it back to — <label>").
- **GST Credit Note** for sales returns: Return panel has a **🧾 GST Credit Note** button (shown once a GSTIN is set). It generates a proper Section-34 credit note for the **returned items only** (no shipping/discounts), reversing **CGST+SGST (TN) or IGST (other states)** against the original tax invoice — this is the document to report in GSTR-1 for the return. `generateCreditNoteHTML()` reuses the invoice engine via `generateInvoiceHTML(order,settings,{creditNote:true})`.
- Return request already captures: items, reason, damage photo, resolution (refund/coins), courier + consignment, status timeline, refund record. Now also the selected return address + GST credit note.

## Perf
- Initial-load splash hold trimmed **2000ms → 1400ms** (`SPLASH_MIN_MS` in `index.html`) — logo entrance still plays fully, but the store appears sooner. Only affects fast loads; slow loads still wait for the app to be ready (no blank flash).
- **Saving a product writes only `products/<id>`**, not the whole `products` node. Editing one item used to re-upload the entire catalog (and make every connected client re-download it). Also narrows the window in which an admin save could clobber a customer's concurrent stock decrement.
- **Every Firebase write is time-bounded** (`fbWrite`, 15s; Storage uploads 45s). An RTDB `set()` only settles on server ack, so on a stalled mobile connection it stayed pending forever — that was the "save keeps loading" spinner. The SDK still queues the write and delivers it when the link returns; the UI just stops waiting, and the toast says "Saved on this device — syncing…" when the cloud didn't confirm in time.
- **Cached repeat visits no longer re-render the catalog for nothing.** `cloudSync` compares the cloud copy against what's on screen (`sameCatalog` / `stableJSON`, key-order independent) and keeps the existing array when identical — that's what caused the visible "products update" a beat after the store opened.

## Product options / variations (Phase 1 — Jul 2026)
One product, several variations, each with **its own price and packing weight** — a net's sizes, a pump's capacities, a heater's wattages, a light's `2ft · White · 18W`, a feed's pack weights. The customer opens the product, sees every option with its price, and picks one.
- **Any category can have options now.** `productVariants()` used to return `null` for anything but Live Fish; it now returns whatever the product has saved, and Live Fish additionally keeps its standard pair/trio fallback. `hasVariants()`, `variantHeading()` and `variantFromPrice()` are the new helpers.
- **Admin → product → "🧩 Options / Sizes"** — one row per variation with label, price, packing weight (kg) and an in-stock/sold-out toggle, plus a customer-facing heading you name per product (**Size** / **Capacity** / **Wattage** / **Pack Size**). Leave it empty and the product stays an ordinary single-price item.
- **Two write-path bugs fixed**: the per-option `packagingWeight` was dropped both when *loading* a product into the form and when *saving* it, so per-option shipping weight had never actually persisted despite the shipping code reading it. Dry goods also ignored it entirely (only live fish honoured it) — a 1kg feed pack shipped as if it were 100g.
- **Grid cards**: a product with options shows **"from ₹X"** (cheapest in-stock option) and a **Select** button that opens the product page, instead of blind-adding an arbitrary size. Option-less products are untouched.
- **Reorder / cross-sell** re-add the exact option that was bought, not whichever is first.
- Already handled downstream, no change needed: separate cart lines per option (`key = id|variantId`), and the option name on order history, WhatsApp, email, packing slip, **GST tax invoice** and admin exports.
- **Per-option packing weight is admin-only** — customers never see it. The only weight shown anywhere is the aggregate live-fish parcel estimate at checkout. It is *not* cosmetic: it's what the courier bracket is priced from, so it stays.
- **New category `Medicine`** (💊, purple). Ships as a dry good, so per-option pack weights apply. Set **non-returnable** alongside Feed — both consumables; flip it to the Accessories model (per-product "eligible if damaged" tick) if you'd rather.
- **The options editor starts with one blank row**, and extra rows are added on demand. A blank row is dropped at save, so a product with no options stays a plain single-price item. The customer-facing heading field appears once an option is actually named.
- **Per-option stock (Phase 2 — done).** Each option keeps its own count in `products/<id>/variantStock/<optionId>` (keyed by option id, not array index — options get reordered). Set a **STOCK** number per row in the admin editor; the product's own Stock Count then becomes read-only and shows their sum.
  - An option is sold out when the admin flags it **or** its count hits 0. `productStockTotal()` is the sum across *available* options, so a product whose every option is gone reads Out of Stock everywhere (grid, filters, product page, admin list).
  - Cart quantity is capped by the **chosen option's** stock, not the product-wide pool.
  - Checkout decrements the option's counter and the product total together, each under its own atomic transaction. Cancel/restock reverses both. Transactions abort on products that have no per-option map, so those can't accidentally sprout one.
  - **Backward compatible**: products with no `variantStock` keep the single shared pool they've always used. Nothing changes until you type per-option numbers.
  - Rules published 7 Sept 2026, including the `products/$id/variantStock/$vid` rule, mirroring the existing `stockCount` policy (authenticated users may only *decrease* it; admin unrestricted via the cascading parent rule). Without it, a customer's checkout write to the per-option counter is denied and only the product total moves.
- **Fixed: a fully sold-out product used to still sell.** With every option flagged sold out, the page showed "In Stock", the Add button was live, and a sold-out option went into the cart. Availability now derives from the options themselves.
- Not yet done: static SEO pages under `/p/` still print a single price and should say "from ₹X" for option products.

## Stability & performance audit (Jul 2026)
Measured with an instrumented browser session, not eyeballed.

**Long lists were the lag.** The admin rendered every order it had in one pass with no cap, and the cost scaled linearly: 10 orders 64ms → 500 orders **501ms** of frozen UI and 5754 DOM nodes, every time the panel opened. Orders accumulate forever, so it worsens daily. The shop grid had the same shape (300 products = 215ms, 5953 nodes).
- Admin orders + products render 25 at a time with a "Show N more" that reports how many are hidden; the window resets on filter/search change and search still reaches past the cap.
- The shop grid renders 24 and grows automatically as you reach the end (IntersectionObserver, 400px margin) with a button fallback.
- **After: admin flat at 57-76ms / 530 nodes for 10→500 orders; shop 0ms / 665 nodes for 20→300 products.**

**Stuck spinners.** 24 busy-flag handlers set `saving/busy = true` then awaited without a guard — any failure left the control disabled forever. All now use try/catch/**finally** and surface the error. Worst was **payment-proof submit**: a customer whose submit failed had no way to retry. Verified by injecting failures — the control re-enables, reports, and stays retryable.

**Unbounded cloud calls.** A Firebase promise that never settles can't be rescued by `finally`, since `finally` waits on the await.
- Every read is now time-bounded. Referral validation (the checkout Apply button) and the admin full-backup export could previously hang forever.
- User-facing writes go through `fbWrite`'s 15s cap: order placement, settings, reviews, media.

**Checked and found clean:** 60fps idle and after navigation; zero long tasks on the storefront; heap flat at 5-8MB with no growth over an idle period; DOM node count constant across navigation; no runaway timers or rAF loops; all 6 live `.on("value")` listeners have matching `.off()`; the store is fully usable with the backend unreachable. The 4 outstanding `nemo-fb-ready` listeners are 4 distinct effects each with its own cleanup, not a leak.

## Ambient jellyfish (Jul 2026)
A single kawaii jellyfish drifts bottom→top in a slow zig-zag; when it clears the top, the next one starts from the bottom after a short pause. Lives in `index.html` next to the bubble-wallpaper canvas (`#nemo-jelly`, `z-index:-1`, `pointer-events:none`).
- **Drawn as inline SVG, not a flat image**, so the bell can actually contract and the tentacles trail behind it. A PNG could only be slid around as one rigid piece.
- **Pulse-and-sink, the way a jellyfish actually travels**: a hard shove upward on the bell contraction, then it drifts back down a touch while the bell refills. Net travel is upward, but it arrives as visible little hops rather than a steady slide. Arms and tentacles run on a lagged phase because they're dragged, not driven; each tentacle also has a staggered CSS ripple so they don't move as one comb.
- **Travels straight up**, no zig-zag — each drifter takes a fresh lane so they cover the whole screen width over time. Calm net climb is ~12-15 px/sec, just above the wallpaper bubbles (~2-11 px/sec).
- **Sized well under half the betta/clownfish** (those render 72-78px wide; the jellyfish bell is ~25px).
- **Pointer or touch nearby wakes it**: within 78px it pulses harder and climbs ~3x faster, then eases back to its calm drift. Wakes fast, calms slowly. The layer stays `pointer-events:none`, so proximity is measured against the pointer rather than hover — a tap stays "hot" for 1.6s since a touch is instantaneous.
- Honours `prefers-reduced-motion` (hidden entirely) and pauses on tab-hide. Transform-only animation, one element on screen at a time.
- To swap in a different jellyfish, edit `svg(uid)` in that block — but keep the `.jelly-bell` / `.jelly-arms` / `.jelly-tents` groups, since the animation drives those by class.

## Product page fixes (Jul 2026)
- **Coming Soon products no longer show a stock badge.** The title/price area read "● In Stock" off the product's leftover `stockCount` while the bottom bar correctly said Coming Soon. It now shows a "🔜 Coming Soon" badge instead; normal products are unchanged.
- **Descriptions keep the line breaks you type.** The product page renders `p.desc` with `white-space: pre-wrap`, so paragraphs, blank lines and bullet lists appear as entered instead of collapsing into one run-on block.

## Admin panel — Back button & product form (Jul 2026)
- **Hardware/browser Back inside Admin no longer drops out of the panel.** It steps back one level at a time: an open product form or order detail closes first (`backRef` handler registered by `AdminHub`); at the top level an in-app sheet asks **"Leave the Admin panel?"** (`AdminExitConfirm`). `window.confirm` is unreliable inside a `popstate` handler on mobile, hence the in-app dialog. The header's "🛍 Store" button and the `beforeunload` refresh/close guard are unchanged.
- **Admin headers are safe-area aware** (`.admin-head` → `env(safe-area-inset-top) + 24px`). The page ships `viewport-fit=cover`, so in the installed app the layout runs *under* the status bar; the old flat `52px` left the header's small controls in the strip the system reserves for the notification pull-down, where taps get eaten. Header buttons are now ≥44px tall, and the Products tab has a full-width **➕ Add New Product** button in the body as an always-reachable twin of the header's "+ Add".
- **The product-save spinner can no longer hang.** `handleSave` wraps the work in try/catch/**finally**, so `saving` always clears and a failure shows "Couldn't save — <reason>" instead of turning forever. The button also names the current step ("Processing photo 1 of 2 — 4.1MB…", "Uploading photo 1 of 2…", "Making the catalog thumbnail…", "Saving product…") so a big photo reads as progress. A photo that fails to decode now says so instead of silently vanishing.

## Also pending (non-Play)
- **SEO off-site**: Search Console resubmit `sitemap.xml` + request indexing; **create Google Business Profile** (biggest lever); Justdial/IndiaMART.
- **Firebase rules**: user already PUBLISHED the `abandonedCarts` rule. ✅
- Audit report at `AUDIT_REPORT.md` (76/100). Phase-1 quick wins done (ErrorBoundary, minified `app.js`, GA4, lighter OG). Not yet: best-sellers row, species spec fields+filters, accessibility pass, FCM push.

## Deploy/merge workflow used this session
Work on branch `claude/repo-connection-j006nq` → commit → open PR to `main` → squash-merge → Vercel auto-deploys `main`. (Claude has GitHub MCP write access + merges directly when user says "go".) SW cache currently `nemo-v38`; bump on each release.

## Welcome popup, Coming Soon lockdown & courier-collection notice (Aug 2026)
- **"Why we're not like the others" popup** — `WhyNemoPopup`, shown once on the **first visit of each day** (date stamp in `localStorage` under `nemo-whyus-day`; opening writes the stamp, so a reload the same day won't repeat it). Held back 1.1s after the splash clears and never rendered over the admin panel. Content is an Others-vs-Us comparison driven by the `WHY_US_ROWS` array — edit that one array to change the copy: points on every rupee, no extra shipping charge (overcharge refunded to the wallet), referral rewards on a friend's 1st purchase, frequent discounts, product sourcing on request, care-guide posters + Aqua Tools, 100% trustable, order-tracking help. Footer carries a small "Subject to our terms & conditions" link into the Terms page.
- **Coming Soon products can no longer be bought.** The guard now lives in `addToCart` itself, so every path is covered (option picker, cross-sell, reorder, "buy it again", a cart restored from an earlier session) — a positive-qty add for a `comingSoon` product is refused with a toast; negative qty still passes so an existing line can always be removed. The actual leak was the **product page's `VariantPicker`**: an option product flagged Coming Soon still rendered a per-option `+ Add`/stepper. It now gets `addToCart={null}`, which the picker already handles by hiding those controls, so options stay visible for reference only. Lines already sitting in a saved cart for a product that has since been flagged are **pruned when the catalog loads**, with a toast naming the item.
- **Courier-collection notice at checkout** — an amber card directly above "Place Order & Pay": keep tracking the parcel and collect it from the courier partner as soon as it reaches your area; door delivery depends on the courier partner and is not in our hands; extra emphasis appears automatically when the cart holds live items. The same substance is in the **Terms & Conditions** as the `COURIER_COLLECT_TERM` constant — it is spliced into `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.termsPolicy`, and the Terms page additionally renders it as a standing clause **only when the saved terms text doesn't already contain it** (a store that customised its terms before this existed still shows the clause; the default text shows it once, not twice).

## Pre-launch hardening (Aug 2026) — ⚠ REQUIRES PUBLISHING `database.rules.json`
Audit of security / money / GST / export ahead of the Play production release. **Every visitor is signed in anonymously (`signInAnonymously`), so every `"auth != null"` rule means "anyone on the internet"** — that framing drives most of what follows.

- **Public vs private settings.** `settings` is world-readable, and `saveSettings` used to write the whole object there — including `adminPassHash`, `coAdminUid` and the proprietor's `returnAddress*`. Those six keys (`PRIVATE_SETTING_KEYS`) now go to a new **`settingsPrivate`** node restricted to the admin uid; `loadSettings` and `cloudSync` merge the two halves, and saving also *removes* the old copies from the public node. `upiId` and the EmailJS ids deliberately stay public — the customer's own browser renders the UPI QR and sends the order email, so a static site cannot hide them; **lock EmailJS down with an allowed-domains restriction in the EmailJS dashboard instead.** The customer-facing return-address fallback ("message us on WhatsApp for the address") now applies until the admin snapshots an address onto the return request.
- **Orders are no longer customer-rewritable.** `orders/$uid` had a blanket `.write`, so a signed-in customer could restate `amountDue`, flip `paymentStatus` to Verified, or **delete the record** you must keep for six years (§36 CGST). The grant moved down to `$oid` with `newData.exists()` (no customer deletes), and `.validate` freezes `id`/`orderNo`/`placedAt`/`userUid` plus `total`/`fee`/`amountDue`/`couponDiscount`/`referralDiscount`/`loyaltyDiscount` against non-admin change. `status` is limited to Awaiting Payment / Payment Review / Cancelled (or unchanged) and `paymentStatus` can never be set to Verified by a customer. Safe because the customer app holds a **live listener** on `orders/<uid>`, so its copy matches the server. Trade-off: if that copy is stale (offline, or the admin edits shipping in the same instant) a customer action is denied and needs a retry after sync.
- **`orderSeq/$day` is increment-only** (`newData === data + 1`, first write must be 1). Anyone could previously set it to any number, producing duplicate or rolled-back invoice numbers — which GST does not allow.
- **Reviews are owner-locked** (`uid` must match `auth.uid` to create, and match the existing row to edit/delete). Previously any visitor could forge or wipe any review.
- **`analytics` and `promoUsage` counters are increment-only**, so daily promo quotas can't be reset and the visitor count can't be rewritten.
- **Testimonials are moderated** like tank photos: `approved:false` on submit, hidden from the home page until approved, author sees a "awaiting approval" note, admin list sorts pending first with a ✓ Approve button. The rule also stops a non-admin writing `approved:true`.
- **Export fixes.** `csvCell()` neutralises **CSV formula injection** — a customer typing `=…`/`+`/`-`/`@` into their name or address used to execute as a formula when the owner opened the file. Orders sheet gains **Counts for GST**, **Supply Type** and **HSN Breakup** columns, and blanks the tax columns for cancelled/unpaid orders (`countsForGST`) so a stray row can't inflate what you file. New **🧾 GST HSN summary (GSTR-1)** export (`exportGstHsnCSV`) gives one row per HSN + rate, split intra/inter-state, with a total row and a note stating how many orders were skipped. "Wallet Coins Earned" now only counts Delivered orders (coins are credited on delivery).
- Helpers verified against fake storage / stub data: `countsForGST` (5 cases), `csvCell` (6 cases), and `orderGST`'s HSN rows reconciling to the order totals both intra- and inter-state.

**GST engine rebuilt (Aug 2026, on the CA's written advice) — `orderTaxLines()` is now the single source of truth** for the tax invoice, the credit note, the orders export and the GSTR-1 HSN export, so those four can no longer disagree.
- **Discounts come off BEFORE tax (§15(3)(a)).** Coupon + referral + wallet are apportioned across every line in proportion to value (rounding remainder handed to the largest line), then tax is back-calculated out of the discounted, GST-inclusive net. Matches the CA's worked example exactly: ₹1000 incl. GST − ₹100 coupon @5% → taxable ₹857.14, GST ₹42.86, total ₹900. Previously it taxed the pre-discount ₹1000 and over-declared.
- **GST is claimed PER PRODUCT, never store-wide.** New product fields `gstApplicable` (default **false**), `hsn`, `gstRate`, edited under "🧾 Claim GST on this product" in the product editor and snapshotted onto the cart line at add-to-cart (they were never plumbed through before, so the per-item override the invoice read had always been dead code). The store-wide **HSN setting is gone**; Settings now shows a per-product explainer plus a warning listing any product that claims GST but is missing an HSN or rate.
- **Goods sold without claiming GST carry no tax at all** — not "0%". They are reported as a separate "no GST claimed" value, and an order made up entirely of them is labelled **BILL OF SUPPLY** rather than TAX INVOICE.
- **Shipping follows the principal supply** (the largest goods line), so freight on a live-fish order carries no GST, and on an equipment order it takes that item's rate. It used to be hard-wired to the store default.
- Exports carry `No-GST Value`, and the HSN summary has `GST Claimed` Yes/No so exempt supplies are never reported at 0%.
- Verified numerically (6 scenarios): the CA's example, a no-GST fish order, a mixed basket where the discount splits across a taxed and an untaxed line, an inter-state two-rate basket, the credit-note shape, and an over-large discount flooring at zero. In every case `taxable + no-GST value + tax === invoice value`.

⚠ **Two consequences to know:** every existing product defaults to `gstApplicable:false`, so nothing bills GST until the owner ticks it product by product; and reprinting an invoice for an order placed BEFORE this change will now show no GST (its items carry no tax fields), where it previously printed the store default rate.

~~**Also check:** the default `termsPolicy` still contains "we are currently … not registered under GST, so no GST is charged at present" while the GSTIN is live — if the saved settings still carry that sentence it contradicts the tax invoices.~~ **Fixed — see "Address privacy, vanishing care guides & the GST notice" below.**

## Checkout, navigation & invoice pass (Aug 2026)

Six changes, all in `app.jsx`. Merged as PRs #69 and #70.

- **Invoice signature.** The block printed captions describing a signing that never happens —
  `For <firm>` above the area, plus `Authorized Signatory` and a small `This is Auto-Generated`
  under an uploaded image. It now carries exactly one of two things: the signature uploaded in
  Settings, or the line `This is auto generated & not required signature`. Applies to every
  document `generateInvoiceHTML` produces — tax invoice, credit note, proforma.
- **Admin order page shows the product photo.** `AdminOrderDetail` was never handed `products`
  or `mediaCache`, so its Order Items tile could only draw the category emoji — order lines are
  checkout-time snapshots carrying no image. It now resolves the photo from the live catalogue
  with `getCartLineImg()`, the helper the cart and order history already use, and names the
  variant on the line.
- **Back returns where you were.** There was one `prevPageRef` and only the product page set it,
  so every other screen hard-coded `nav("home")` — Checkout went Home from a Cart entry. Replaced
  with a real trail: `nav()` pushes the screen being left, `goBack()` pops it and restores that
  screen's scroll. The phone Back button and every in-app back arrow now run the same `goBack`.
  Sign-in screens and the admin panel stay off the trail (`NO_RETURN_PAGES`); depth capped at 25.
  `navRewind(page)` rewinds to a screen already behind them instead of stacking on it.
- **Cancelled payment keeps the cart.** `placeOrder` empties the cart, so "Cancel payment" left a
  cancelled order and nothing to buy. `cancelPaymentAndRestoreCart()` returns the order's lines to
  the cart and lands the shopper there. The auto-cancel on payment-window expiry is deliberately
  NOT wired to this — it runs from a background sweep over every order, on any device, and must
  not rewrite whatever is in the cart at the time.
- **Checkout trimmed.** "Delivery Notes" removed (Order Summary / Special Requests stays);
  "Add more items" removed from both steps; the coupon/referral box now renders once, on the
  payment step beside the total, instead of on both. Steps read **Address → Payment → Confirm
  Order** and step 2 is headed "Payment".
- **Address step reversed for returning customers.** Saved and past-order addresses are the step
  now — "Use this" and continue — with the most recent filled in on arrival so Continue works on
  the first press. The form stays shut behind "Deliver to a new address" (`addrFormOpen`) and
  opens by itself for a first-time customer. The WhatsApp-updates checkbox moved out of the form:
  it belongs to the order, not the address card.
- **Customer-cancelled orders hidden.** `cancelledByCustomer()` (module level, beside
  `deliveredAtOf`) drops them from the customer's order page and from the admin's working list.
  Two exceptions on purpose: an order with a refund still owed stays visible to both sides, and
  the admin's **Cancelled** filter still lists them. Store-made cancellations are untouched.

⚠️ **Build lesson from this session.** These commits were first rebuilt with the bare
`npx esbuild …` line from the handbook, which updates `app.js` and nothing else. `APP_BUILD`,
`version.json` and `sw.js`'s `CACHE` stayed put, so every open tab would have decided it was
already current and the service worker would have kept serving the old bundle — the exact
failure `scripts/build.mjs` was written to prevent. Fixed by running `node scripts/build.mjs`
(build `v90.784b1ecc` → `v90.e09b7cd3`), and `HANDBOOK.md` §4 now documents the script instead
of the raw command.

## Address privacy, vanishing care guides & the GST notice (Aug 2026)

Four things, all in `app.jsx`, plus a regenerated export lib in NEMO-ANALYTICS.

- **Other customers' addresses could reach the checkout address picker.** The database rules were
  never the hole — they only ever let the admin uid read all of `orders`, and a customer read
  `orders/<their uid>`. The leak was on the client. The admin panel's listener puts EVERY
  customer's orders into the same `orders` state a shopper's session uses; the address-book seed
  was guarded only by `page !== "admin"`, and on the way *out* of the admin panel `page` changes
  before the customer listener replaces `orders` — so the seed ran once against the all-customers
  array and filed strangers' names, phones and street addresses into the local book, where they
  showed as pickable "FROM A PAST ORDER" cards at checkout and on the payment step, permanently.
  `seedAddressBook` now checks `userUid` on every order it reads instead of trusting its caller,
  so no stray array can contribute an address whatever the effect ordering. Books already poisoned
  are repaired once on next load (`purgeForeignAddrEntries`): order-derived rows are dropped and
  re-derived from the user's own orders, while addresses the customer typed themselves are kept.
  Two further doors shut: the admin's all-orders snapshot now caches under its own
  `nemo-orders-admin` key instead of the shared `nemo-orders` one that boot reads before anyone
  is authenticated, and a shared cache found holding more than one owner is discarded rather than
  shown. Covered by `test/addressbook.test.mjs`, and verified end-to-end with the two demo
  accounts: after Rahul orders, Priya's checkout offers no picker and shows none of his details.
- **Care Guides disappeared on their own.** Nothing was deleted. `[]` is truthy, so once anything
  left an empty list in `nemo-guides` — a wipe, deleting the last guide, a reset while the cloud
  was unreachable — `localGuidesData()||DEFAULT_GUIDES` handed back the empty array and the page
  rendered "No guides yet" forever, because every later fallback is also `|| DEFAULT`. The same
  trap emptied the shop via `nemo-products`. Cached lists now read as "no cache" when empty, and
  parsing is guarded (a corrupt entry used to throw inside the boot path, before first paint).
  Reproduced in Chromium before the fix and confirmed restored after.
- **"Not registered under GST" removed — but only where it is false.** The sentence is rewritten
  on the way through `normalizeSettings`, so the copy saved in Firebase stops showing it
  everywhere at once without the owner editing anything, and **only when a GSTIN is configured** —
  a store with no GSTIN still shows the notice, where it is correct. The replacement does not
  promise a Tax Invoice on every order, because GST is claimed per product and a basket we claim
  no GST on is a Bill of Supply.
- **Live-Fish Packing is folded at checkout**, reusing the existing `Collapsible`. The header
  carries the selected packing, its charge and whether the guarantee holds; the "no DOA cover"
  warning sits outside the fold so it cannot be closed away.

⚠ `src/live/store-export-lib.js` in NEMO-ANALYTICS is generated from `app.jsx` and vendors
`normalizeSettings`, so it was regenerated (`npm run extract:store -- <path>/app.jsx`); its
`--check` mode is what catches this drift. 288 analytics tests pass against the new copy.

## Gotchas
- Sandbox network blocks the live site and the CDNs the page loads (unpkg, gstatic), but the app
  **can** be rendered here: `npm i react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1 playwright@1.56.0` (1.56 is the
  version whose Chromium matches `/opt/pw-browsers`), serve the folder, and point a copy of
  `index.html` at the local React UMD builds. Firebase stays down, so the app runs on
  `DEFAULT_PRODUCTS`/`DEFAULT_GUIDES` — enough to click through checkout via the demo accounts.
  Seed `localStorage` from a non-app page (e.g. `/robots.txt`): a live app instance persists its
  own cart and will overwrite anything written while it is running.
  (This supersedes the old note that the app could not be rendered in the sandbox at all — it can,
  and a rendered check caught the care-guides regression that code review alone had missed.)
- The keystore in the PWABuilder package is the permanent app signing key — user keeps it secret; never commit it.
