# The Android app — what is actually shipped

The Nemo Aqua Store app on Google Play (`in.nemoaquastore.app`) is a **Kotlin WebView
wrapper**, not a Trusted Web Activity. This document exists because that is easy to get
wrong: the repository also contains `android-twa/`, which is a *plan* for rebuilding the app
as a TWA and has never produced a shipped build. Read the distinction below before touching
either.

| | Shipped app | `android-twa/` |
|---|---|---|
| Kind | Kotlin WebView wrapper | Bubblewrap TWA config |
| Project | `~/AndroidStudioProjects/NemoAquaStore` (local only, **not in this repo**) | this folder |
| Build file | `app/build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin DSL) | `app/build.gradle` (Groovy, generated) |
| Launcher | `.MainActivity` | `…androidbrowserhelper.trusted.LauncherActivity` |
| Play version code | 12 (`2.0.1`), Sep 2026 | `1` / `1.0.0-backup` placeholder — never shipped |
| Renders with | Android System WebView | Chrome |

Both are signed for the same package, and `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` carries the two
SHA-256 fingerprints either would need.

## Why the distinction bites

A WebView is not Chrome. It advertises itself with `; wv` and `Version/4.0` in the
User-Agent, and payment SDKs read that as "this page cannot hand off to another app" —
because in a naive wrapper it cannot. Razorpay Checkout responds by **silently removing UPI**
from the payment list, leaving only cards, netbanking and wallets. Nothing errors; the option
is simply absent, and only on the app.

That is worth restating because of how it presents: identical site, identical account,
identical Razorpay configuration, UPI visible in the phone's browser and in the installed
PWA, missing only in the app.

## The two changes that fix it

Both live in the local Android project, so they are recorded here — losing that Mac would
otherwise lose them silently.

**1. `MainActivity.configureWebView()` — stop advertising as a WebView.**

The wrapper appended its own token to the default UA, keeping the WebView markers:

```kotlin
userAgentString = "$userAgentString NemoAquaStoreAndroid/2.0"   // before
```

```kotlin
userAgentString = userAgentString                               // after
    .replace("; wv", "")
    .replace(Regex("""Version/\d+(\.\d+)*\s+"""), "") +
        " NemoAquaStoreAndroid/2.0"
```

This is honest rather than a spoof: `handleUrl()` in the same file already launches both
`intent://` URLs (via `Intent.parseUri(…, URI_INTENT_SCHEME)`) and any other scheme (via
`openExternal`, an `ACTION_VIEW` intent). The app genuinely can hand off to a UPI app; only
the advertisement said otherwise.

Nothing on the website reads this string — `nemoInApp` comes from `display-mode: standalone`
(`index.html:522`) — so the Nemo suffix is kept only to keep the app identifiable in logs.

**2. `AndroidManifest.xml` — make UPI apps visible.**

```xml
<intent>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <data android:scheme="upi" />
</intent>
```

Razorpay hands off to a chosen app with an explicit `package=` in the `intent://` URL. On
Android 11+, `startActivity` into a package the app cannot *see* throws
`ActivityNotFoundException` regardless of whether that app is installed. Without this entry
UPI appears and then fails at the hand-off with "No compatible app found" — a worse failure
than not offering it, because it happens mid-payment.

## Where the app actually is on Play

**Production has never been active.** The two version codes that were actually released, 11
and 12, sit on the *closed testing* track only, so no ordinary Play user has ever installed this app — every customer
ordering today came through the website. Production is gated behind Google's closed-testing
requirement for personal developer accounts: at least 12 testers opted in continuously for
14 days, then an application.

| Version code | Name | Date | Track | Carries the UPI fixes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | `2.0.0` | Aug 2026 | Closed testing | no |
| 12 | `2.0.1` | Sep 2026 | Closed testing | yes — **verified at checkout on a Play-signed install** |
| 13 | `2.0.2` | Sep 2026 | Closed testing — live 7 Sep 2026 | yes, plus push notifications and the sign-in retry |

**Until version code 13 is installed, no notification of any kind can arrive.** That gate is
now open — 13 reached closed testing on 7 Sep 2026, and the first real notification, a new care
guide, was delivered the same day. It is recorded because of how it was found: the build sat
unuploaded for a release while the server half was debugged against a phone that could not
receive anything — so if notifications are silent, check the installed version code first, not
the code. Every sender
in `api/cron-push.js` — shipped, delivered, back in stock, weekly tank care, new care guide —
ends at `notifyUser()`, which reads `pushTokens/<uid>` and does nothing when it is empty. That
node is written only by `savePushToken()` in `app.jsx`, which runs only when the wrapper calls
`window.__nemoPushToken`, and only version code 13 calls it. The site has no web-push
subscription either — there is no `pushManager.subscribe` anywhere — so a browser is not a way
round it. A toggle switched on against a store running version 12 is a preference recorded and
nothing more, which is exactly what it looks like from the outside: silence.

That gap is the thing to notice: the two fixes below sat in the local working copy for a
release without ever being built into a bundle, because the version code was never bumped
off 11. UPI was fixed on the developer's own phone and broken for everyone else, and nothing
in the repository would have shown it — `versionCode` lives only on that Mac.

The production application has been refused twice with "Your app requires more testing to
access Google Play production". The third criterion reads *"14 more days starting from the
review date"*, so a refusal appears to restart the count rather than leave it standing —
applying early is not free, it costs another fortnight. Wait out the full window before
pressing **Apply for production**. Publishing further closed-testing releases during that
window is fine and resets nothing; it also gives the testers a reason to open the app, which
is what the requirement is really measuring.

### Installing a Play build over an Android Studio one

The update fails, and Play offers only its generic "check your connection" help. The cause is
signing: Play App Signing re-signs the uploaded bundle with the app signing key, while the
build installed from Android Studio carries the upload key, and Android refuses to update an
app whose signature does not match. Uninstall the developer build first, then install from the
testing link — it is a fresh install rather than an update, and every Play update after that
behaves normally. Uninstalling clears the WebView's data, so the customer is signed out and the
locally-stored tank profile is gone; orders, wallet and referral code live in Firebase and are
untouched.

## Building a release bundle

macOS ships no system Java, so Gradle stops with "Unable to locate a Java Runtime" until it
is pointed at the JDK inside Android Studio:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
./gradlew clean bundleRelease
```

The bundle lands at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

Use the Gradle task rather than *Build → Generate Signed App Bundle*. The menu dialog asks
for a keystore path and passwords of its own and ignores the `keystore.properties` signing
config the build file already defines — and that config is the one wired to the original
upload key. A different key cannot update the existing listing, and there is no way back
from that except a support request.

Two warnings are expected on every build and neither matters: `Unable to strip …
libdatastore_shared_counter.so` during the build, and Play's *no deobfuscation file* / *no
native debug symbols* notices on upload. The native library belongs to AndroidX, not to
this app.

### R8, and the two rules that keep the bridge alive

`buildTypes.release` sets `optimization { enable = true }` and points `proguardFiles` at
`proguard-android-optimize.txt` plus the app's own `app/proguard-rules.pro`. Turned on for
version code 14 on 16 September 2026, to clear Play's *App optimisation is below our
threshold* flag and its **Fix by Feb 2027** date.

It was off until then, deliberately, and the reason was `AndroidShareBridge`. Its three
`@JavascriptInterface` methods — `share`, `openWhatsApp`, `signInWithGoogle` — are never
called from Kotlin, only from JavaScript by name, through the object registered as
`NemoAndroid`. R8 therefore reads them as dead code and strips them, which breaks native
sharing and Google sign-in **in release builds only** — the worst shape a bug can take,
because a debug run looks perfect.

Two rules hold it open. The bridge is an *inner* class of `MainActivity`, so its real name
carries the `$`:

```proguard
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface <methods>;
}
-keep class in.nemoaquastore.app.MainActivity$AndroidShareBridge { *; }
```

What is deliberately **not** there is a package-wide `-keep class in.nemoaquastore.app.** { *; }`.
That builds, runs and passes every test — and leaves the obfuscation score exactly where it
started, which is the one thing Play was asking about.

**What it bought.** Uncompressed DEX went 14,262,792 → 2,425,624 bytes, the bundle 6.5 MB →
3.6 MB, and Play's *size for new installs* 5.8 MB → 1.6 MB. It also puts a real `mapping.txt`
in the bundle, so the *no deobfuscation file* upload warning is gone and crash reports
deobfuscate.

The 10 MB figure is why this mattered at all: Play enforces the DEX threshold only on bundles
carrying at least 10 MB of *uncompressed* DEX. Measure it, rather than reading the download
size, which is two to three times smaller:

```bash
unzip -l app-release.aab | grep -E '\.dex$' | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'
```

At 14.26 MB this app was over the line, so the deadline genuinely applied. It no longer does.

**Verified on a device, version code 14.** Google sign-in, UPI present in the Razorpay sheet,
a push notification arriving, native sharing and the WhatsApp hand-off — all on the
Play-signed build from the internal testing track.

One trap worth writing down. A release APK built locally is signed with the **upload**
keystore, and that certificate's SHA-1 is not registered with the OAuth client: Firebase holds
the debug certificate and Google's app-signing certificate, not that one. So Google sign-in
always fails on a locally installed release build, with *"No Google account is available on
this device"* — with R8 or without it. Do not read that as a keep-rule failure. Sign-in can
only be tested on a Play-signed build.

## What version code 13 added

Push notifications end to end, and the sign-in retry. All three items that had been pending are
now shipped and verified on a device.

**Firebase Cloud Messaging.** `firebase-messaging` in `app/build.gradle.kts` (no version — the
BOM supplies it), `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` and a `.NemoMessagingService` entry in the manifest, and
the service itself, which draws every notification. Messages are sent data-only precisely so
that it always runs — see the reasoning in `lib/push.mjs`.

`MainActivity` fetches the token once per launch, asks for the notification permission after the
first page has loaded (so the dialog appears over the store rather than a blank screen), and
hands the token to `window.__nemoPushToken`, which stores it under the signed-in uid. Tokens are
not listened for: a rotated one reaches the site the next time the app opens, and the server
drops the dead one the first time FCM rejects it.

### Two things cost far more than the code did

**The injection has to wait for the page.** `index.html` runs `fetch("app.js").then(…)`, so the
bundle is evaluated well after `onPageFinished` fires. Injecting once found no hook and did
nothing at all. `deliverPushToken()` now polls every 250 ms for fifteen seconds — the same shape
as the Google sign-in injection directly above it in the file.

**`database.rules.json` is not deployed by anything.** The repo copy is a record; the live rules
only change when someone pastes them into the Firebase Console and presses Publish. The root is
`".write": false`, so a node with no rule is denied — and `savePushToken()` in `app.jsx` ends in
`.catch(()=>{})`, so the rejection left no trace anywhere. It looked identical to the token never
arriving, and cost an hour of looking at the wrong half of the system.

### The care-guide switch needed a rule too

The bell on the Care Guides page promised "tell me when there's a new guide" and nothing ever
sent one: the preference lived in `localStorage` and was read by a single guard in
`sendLocalNotif` that no caller ever triggered. It now writes `guideSubs/<uid>`, and the cron
sends through FCM like every other notification.

**That means another manual Console publish.** `database.rules.json` gained a `guideSubs` node;
until it is pasted into the Firebase Console and published, the root `".write": false` denies
the subscription write and the switch is dead again — with the same silent failure mode that
cost an hour last time. **The switch now says so on screen** — a refused write shows
"Saved. Couldn't subscribe you on the server." under the bell, and the write also logs
`nemo-push: guideSubs write rejected`. So the state of the rule can be read off the phone: turn
the bell on in Care Guides, and that note appearing means the rule is not published.

Two lessons worth keeping. A silent catch on a write is expensive every single time it fires;
that one is worth replacing with a `console.warn`. And when a chain has five links and no
output, make the app say what it sees rather than reasoning about which link broke — the
`nemo-push:` lines in Logcat (token length, injection target, whether the hook answered) are
kept for that reason, and a temporary probe that wrote the row itself, uncaught, is what finally
printed `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

### Google sign-in

`getGoogleCredential()` retries once after 700 ms on `NoCredentialException`. That exception
means Play services has not finished populating the account list, not that no account exists,
which is exactly why the second tap always worked. Cancelling throws
`GetCredentialCancellationException`, a different type, so the retry can never re-prompt someone
who dismissed the picker deliberately. Customers no longer see Java class names; the exception
goes to Logcat under `NemoAuth` instead.

## Still open

- **Edge-to-edge under Android 15+.** The release dashboard flagged *deprecated APIs or
  parameters for edge-to-edge* against release 13. Every call site it named sits inside
  `com.google.android.material`, not in this app, so the fix was a dependency bump: Material
  1.10.0 → 1.14.0 in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, shipped in version code 14. Whether the page
  itself ever clips under the status bar or the gesture pill is a separate question, and the
  web layer already handles it — `viewport-fit=cover` in `index.html` plus
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` throughout `app.jsx`.
- `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` is in the manifest and is not needed — the app only ever
  loads `https://www.nemoaquastore.in`. Left alone during the qualifying run because a
  third-party subresource loading over http would fail silently, and only in release.
- `FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().token` compiles with a deprecation warning. It works and is
  the documented way to fetch a registration token; revisit when the BOM next moves.
- The notification's small icon is `ic_launcher`, which Android flattens to a white silhouette.
  A dedicated monochrome drawable would look better.
- The admin `loadOrders()` reads the whole `orders` node. Fine now; paginate before ~5,000
  orders.

## If the app is ever migrated to a TWA

`android-twa/` holds the configuration for it and the asset links are already live, so the
groundwork exists. A TWA runs real Chrome, which removes this class of problem entirely — no
UA handling, no package-visibility declarations, every payment method behaving as it does in
the browser.

The cost is that `MainActivity` carries behaviour a TWA would need re-homed: the
`NemoAndroid` JavaScript bridge for native sharing and Google sign-in, WhatsApp Business
preference on `whatsapp:` links, and install-banner suppression. Verify each before
switching, and ship as the next version code with the **same upload key** — a different key
cannot update the existing Play listing.
