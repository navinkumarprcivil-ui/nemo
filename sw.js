   here as WebP only: the splash asks for the WebP, so the PNG beside it is
   reached only by a browser that cannot read WebP, and precaching 160 KB for a
   fallback almost nobody takes cost more on a first visit than the whole
   document does. A browser that does need it fetches it on demand, and the
   cache-first handler below keeps it from then on.

   app.jsx is excluded for exactly the same reason, and it cost far more: index.html runs the
   precompiled app.js on the fast path and only falls back to compiling the JSX source when
   app.js is missing. Precaching it downloaded ~276 KB gzipped of source, on the first visit,
   competing with the app itself, for a path almost nobody takes — and one that cannot arise
   offline anyway, since app.js is precached right here. The .jsx handler below is
   network-first with a cache fallback, so a browser that genuinely needs it still gets it. */

/* ── Push ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing sends these yet. The weekly tank-care reminder is fired by the app when it is
 * opened (see careDue() in app.jsx), because a static site on Vercel has no sender and a
 * closed phone cannot be woken without one. This half is here so that when a sender is added
 * — FCM credentials plus a scheduled function posting to the customer's token — the app
 * already receives and opens the notification correctly, with no service-worker change and
 * so no waiting for every installed client to pick up a new worker.
 *
 * The payload is expected as JSON: {title, body, url}. A push with no readable body still
 * shows something rather than failing silently, because a notification the browser has
 * already committed to showing will display "This site has been updated in the background"
 * if the handler does not show one of its own.
